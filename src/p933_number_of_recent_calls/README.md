[https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/)

## Initial provided code
```Python
class RecentCounter:

    def __init__(self):
        

    def ping(self, t: int) -> int:
        


# Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RecentCounter()
# param_1 = obj.ping(t)
```

## First approach 

- time complexity: O(1)
- space complexity: O(1)
